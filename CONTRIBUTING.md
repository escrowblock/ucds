# Contributing

Thanks for (thinking about) contributing to UCDS, all help is wanted!

## Before Submitting an Issue

First, please do a search in [open issues](https://github.com/escrowblock/ucds/issues/) to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed.

If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your reaction:

üëç - upvote

üëé - downvote

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, submit an issue using the guidelines below.

### Submitting an issue (bug)

* Be as clear and concise as possible.
* Do not submit more than one bug in a single issue.
* Clearly explain the following:

1. Action taken (what you did)
2. Expected result (what you hoped would happen)
3. Actual result (unexpected outcome)
4. Your setup (any and all relevant technical facts, error messages, logs, etc)

### Feature requests

* First consider if **you** yourself might be able to work on the feature?  If so, check out info on contributing code below.
* If you do not have the skills, then please take the time to clearly think through the request. Is it appropriate for all users of UCDS? If so, create a new issue containing the following:

1. Write `[request]` as the first item in the title, followed by a short, concise description, eg: `[request] Add new blockchain`.
2. Fill in details explaining your request. Be as clear and concise as possible and only 1 request at a time.
3. Add mock-ups, etc as needed to clearly demonstrate the idea.
